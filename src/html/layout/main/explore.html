				<p class="explore__text">Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.</p>
				<p class="explore__text">It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a <span class="explore__text--gold">"yellow veil"</span> of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.</p>
				<p class="explore__text">The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different.</p>
